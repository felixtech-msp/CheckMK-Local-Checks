This repository contains a collection of local checks for the Check_MK monitoring system.
They run on Debian based Linux operating systems and may also work with different Linux distributions,
if not explicitly stated otherwise.

In Linux those checks are normally placed in /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local if not stated otherwise.
See the official Check_MK documentation for more information: https://docs.checkmk.com/latest/en/localchecks.html
